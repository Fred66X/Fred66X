 👋 Hi, I’m @Fred66X as well as known as Alfredo Araiza
 
 📊 Welcome to my GitHub repository! dedicated mainly to Data Science and Business Analytics Projects
      I'm a data scientist with a focus on pricing and business analytics. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, analyses, and tools that showcase my expertise in these areas.
      
 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning Models !! well Data Science in fact !!

 👨‍💼 About Me
I am a data scientist with a passion for leveraging data to drive business decisions. My expertise lies in pricing strategies and business analytics, where I use statistical methods, machine learning, and data visualization to uncover insights and optimize performance.

🛠️ Skills
Programming Languages: Python, R, SQL
Data Analysis: pandas, NumPy, dplyr
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, K-Means, xgboost
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2
Tools: Jupyter Colab, Notebook, , Git

📈 Usage
For an easiest usage uploaded from Colab so it's easier for you to use different libraries in case you want to replicate, as sometimes is struggling this process in Visual Studio as Colab has installed already majority.
